MNIST Digit Generation with GANs and DCGANs

👋 About This Project

I built this project to dive deep into the world of generative models—specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their more powerful cousin, Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs). The goal? Teach machines to generate realistic handwritten digits from scratch, using only random noise as input. Kinda like magic, but powered by math and PyTorch.

The MNIST dataset served as the training ground, and through the adversarial setup of generator vs discriminator, the models gradually learned to create convincing digit images.

💡 What You’ll Find Inside

This project walks through:
	•	A basic GAN built with fully connected layers
	•	An enhanced DCGAN with convolutional and transposed convolutional layers
	•	The back-and-forth training dance between generator and discriminator
	•	Real-time visualizations of the digits as they evolve during training
	•	Fixes for common hurdles like shape mismatches and unstable training dynamics

It’s a practical example of how generative AI can learn from existing data and create brand-new content—an idea that powers tons of modern AI applications today.

⸻

✨ Features
	•	Full PyTorch implementation of both GAN and DCGAN
	•	Live loss plots and image previews during training
	•	Easy-to-follow architecture diagrams and code explanations
	•	Training optimized for both CPU and GPU setups
	•	Clean and modular Jupyter Notebook format for experimentation

⸻

🔧 Technologies Used
	•	PyTorch for model implementation
	•	Matplotlib for visualizations
	•	Jupyter Notebook for an interactive experience
	•	MNIST Dataset for training data

⸻

🚀 Getting Started
	1.	Clone this repo
	2.	Open the notebook in VSCode or Jupyter
	3.	Run the cells and train the models
	4.	Play around with hyperparameters or architectures
	5.	Watch your machine generate its own handwritten digits!

⸻

📈 Results

Both models were able to learn digit generation successfully. The DCGAN in particular produced much cleaner, sharper digits compared to the basic GAN, thanks to its convolutional architecture.

⸻

🔮 Future Plans
	•	Add conditional GANs to generate specific digits (e.g., only 3s or 7s)
	•	Try Wasserstein loss for smoother, more stable training
	•	Scale up to generate higher resolution images
	•	Transfer the framework to other datasets (like fashion or faces)

⸻

🗂 Suggested Files for GitHub
	•	Your .ipynb notebook (no need to include dataset files)
	•	A README.md (like this one)
	•	Sample generated images in a folder named results/
	•	A requirements.txt with:

torch
torchvision
matplotlib
